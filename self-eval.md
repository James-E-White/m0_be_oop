# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? I felt better doing the OOP as I felt the scaffolding approach working for me. I had resources to connect with and gain support. I needed to protect my time more as I ran out of it as unforeseeable things happen at my current job.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.? I need to listen to myself more and give more breaks. I currently am used to pushing through until I am too exhausted to work. I need to ensure that it is a productive struggle and not an und-productive one.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need? My schedule needs to be dialed in, and have the tough conversations when I am not getting the support I need.
